      <h1>Hi, I'm Alex</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a QA Engineer based out of the Southeastern United States. This
        site is used to chronicle my journey as a budding front end developer.
        I use JavaScript to build tools that are useful in my day to day.
      </p>
      <p>I don't have many socials, but you can keep up with me here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href='https://github.com/alex-j-garcia'>GitHub</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
